**What is Sprint Ceremony?**
	Sprint ceremonies are structured events in Scrum that help teams plan, track, and improve their work. They include **Sprint Planning** (decide what to do), **Daily Scrum** (sync up), **Sprint Review** (demo & feedback), and **Sprint Retrospective** (process improvement).
	**Types of Sprint Ceremonies**
		**1. Sprint Planning**
			 Purpose: Define _what_ will be delivered in the sprint and _how_ it will be achieved: Attendees: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team.
			 Output: Sprint Goal and Sprint Backlog.
		**2. Daily Scrum (Stand-up)**
			Purpose: A short 15-min meeting for the team to sync up.
			Each member answers:
				What did I do yesterday?
				What will I do today?
				Are there any blockers?
		**3. Sprint Retrospective**
			Purpose: Reflect on the sprint process.
			Team discusses:
				What went well?
				What didnâ€™t go well?
				What can be improved in the next sprint?
				
**What questions will you ask on first day of requirement gathering?**
