**INTEGRATION**
	1. **Data Source Management**
	 The data sources page lets you integrate Appian with external databases using a JDBC connection by adding, updating, and removing named connection configurations called data sources. These data sources are available for designers to use in their applications through [data stores](https://docs.appian.com/suite/help/25.3/Data_Stores.html) and the [Query Database smart service](https://docs.appian.com/suite/help/25.3/Query_Database_Smart_Service.html).
